We have finished development of v2.4.0 and will be releasing it soon.

This version will include a new year-system which will allow you to have multiple years in one account containing all grades, subjects and homework tasks in that year.

<!-- truncate -->

## Migration

Because we added a new year-system all your current grades will be moved to one year with a random name. You can a
change that name in the settings.

We will not (as planned) migrate your account when opening it after the update, but instead we will migrate all accounts at once on our servers.

This migration is planned to be happening between the 29th and the 31st of December.

As the migration will take some time you might not be able to access your account during that time.

### E-Mails

Because new accounts are required to verify their E-Mail-Address we will also require all existing accounts to verify their E-Mail-Address.

When logging in after the update you will be asked to verify your E-Mail-Address.

You can still use your account without verifying your E-Mail-Address **until around the end of January**, but after that you will not be able to use your account anymore until you verify your E-Mail-Address.
