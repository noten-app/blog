We have released v2.4.0! ðŸ¥³

This version includes a new year-system which allows you to have multiple years in one account containing all grades, subjects and homework tasks in that year.

## Migration

The migration is already done on our servers and we will move all users to the new system till the 31st of December.

:::info Migration Issues
Because the migration had some issues some accounts have not already automatically switched to the right year.

To fix this, please open the settings, click on "School-Years" and then click on "preUpdate".

If you want to rename the year just click on "School-Years" > "Manage School-Years" > Choose the year you want to rename > Change the name > Click on "Update Year".

### E-Mails

Because new accounts are required to verify their E-Mail-Address we also require all existing accounts to verify their E-Mail-Address.

When logging in you will be asked to verify your E-Mail-Address.

You can still use your account without verifying your E-Mail-Address **until around the end of January**, but after that you will not be able to use your account anymore until you verify your E-Mail-Address.
