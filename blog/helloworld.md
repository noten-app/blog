Welcome to this blog.  
Here we will post about our progress on the Noten-App and other things you might find interesting.

<!-- truncate -->

## Upcoming version (v2.4.0)

Version 2.4.0 of Noten-App is currently in the end-stages of development and will be released soon.

This version will include a new year-system which will allow you to have multiple years in one account containing all grades, subjects and homework tasks in that year.

More Information about the new year-system will be posted in a separate blog post (planned next week).

### Migration

Because we added a new year-system all your current grades will be moved to one year with a random name. You can a
change that name in the settings.  
The process to update your account to the new version will automatically start when opening it after the update.

### Planned release date

Currently we plan on releasing v2.4.0 in the Week between the 24th and the 31st of December this Year.

## What's next?

### v3.0.0

Because the Source-Code of Noten-App is getting more and more complex and hard to maintain we decided to rewrite the app.  
This will also allow us to add new features more easily and faster.

The Design of the app will nearly stay the same, but we will look into adding some new features and improving old ones.

We are not able to give an release date yet, but we will keep you updated.

### Blog

As this is our first blog post we have not yet decided on how often we will post new blog posts.  
Currently we plan on posting a new blog post every 2 - 4 months and when a new version of Noten-App is released.

Also we are not sure in which languages these will be available.  
Currently we plan on posting them in German and English, but we are not sure if we will be able to do more languages.

We will keep you updated on this topic.

#### Feeds

Multiple feeds are available for this blog.  
A feed is a file which contains all blog posts in a specific format a feed-reader-app can read and display.

If you want to get notified when a new blog post is released you can subscribe to one of these feeds using such a feed-reader-app like feeeed for iOS or Feedly for Android.

### Newsletters

We are working on a newsletter system to keep you updated on the progress of Noten-App.  
As we are not able to send out newsletters yet, we will post updates on this blog.

This newsletter system would allow us to send out newsletters when a new Version of Noten-App is released.  
When it is ready you will be able to subscribe to it in the settings of Noten-App or on our website.

## Development

### APIs

We already have a few APIs for Noten-App but they are not well documented yet and also have some bugs.  
We plan on fully removing the old APIs and replacing them with new ones.
