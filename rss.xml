            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to this blog.<br>
<!-- -->Here we will post about our progress on the Noten-App and other things you might find interesting.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="upcoming-version-v240">Upcoming version (v2.4.0)<a href="https://blog.noten-app.de/hello-world#upcoming-version-v240" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Upcoming version (v2.4.0)" title="Direct link to Upcoming version (v2.4.0)">​</a></h2>
<p>Version 2.4.0 of Noten-App is currently in the end-stages of development and will be released soon.</p>
<p>This version will include a new year-system which will allow you to have multiple years in one account containing all grades, subjects and homework tasks in that year.</p>
<p>More Information about the new year-system will be posted in a separate blog post (planned next week).</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="migration">Migration<a href="https://blog.noten-app.de/hello-world#migration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Migration" title="Direct link to Migration">​</a></h3>
<p>Because we added a new year-system all your current grades will be moved to one year with a random name. You can a
change that name in the settings.<br>
<!-- -->The process to update your account to the new version will automatically start when opening it after the update.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="planned-release-date">Planned release date<a href="https://blog.noten-app.de/hello-world#planned-release-date" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Planned release date" title="Direct link to Planned release date">​</a></h3>
<p>Currently we plan on releasing v2.4.0 in the Week between the 24th and the 31st of December this Year.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What's next?<a href="https://blog.noten-app.de/hello-world#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's next?" title="Direct link to What's next?">​</a></h2>

<p>Because the Source-Code of Noten-App is getting more and more complex and hard to maintain we decided to rewrite the app.<br>
<!-- -->This will also allow us to add new features more easily and faster.</p>
<p>The Design of the app will nearly stay the same, but we will look into adding some new features and improving old ones.</p>
<p>We are not able to give an release date yet, but we will keep you updated.</p>

<p>As this is our first blog post we have not yet decided on how often we will post new blog posts.<br>
<!-- -->Currently we plan on posting a new blog post every 2 - 4 months and when a new version of Noten-App is released.</p>
<p>Also we are not sure in which languages these will be available.<br>
<!-- -->Currently we plan on posting them in German and English, but we are not sure if we will be able to do more languages.</p>
<p>We will keep you updated on this topic.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[More about the upcoming version]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have finished development of v2.4.0 and will be releasing it soon.</p>
<p>This version will include a new year-system which will allow you to have multiple years in one account containing all grades, subjects and homework tasks in that year.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="migration">Migration<a href="https://blog.noten-app.de/v2_4_0-update#migration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Migration" title="Direct link to Migration">​</a></h2>
<p>Because we added a new year-system all your current grades will be moved to one year with a random name. You can a
change that name in the settings.</p>
<p>We will not (as planned) migrate your account when opening it after the update, but instead we will migrate all accounts at once on our servers.</p>
<p>This migration is planned to be happening between the 29th and the 31st of December.</p>
<p>As the migration will take some time you might not be able to access your account during that time.</p>

<p>Because new accounts are required to verify their E-Mail-Address we will also require all existing accounts to verify their E-Mail-Address.</p>
<p>When logging in after the update you will be asked to verify your E-Mail-Address.</p>
<p>You can still use your account without verifying your E-Mail-Address <strong>until around the end of January</strong>, but after that you will not be able to use your account anymore until you verify your E-Mail-Address.</p>]]></content:encoded>
